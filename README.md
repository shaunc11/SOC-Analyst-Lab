## 📌 Project Objective
This lab demonstrates how to detect brute force login attempts in a Windows environment using Splunk. I created a synthetic Windows Security Event Log, ingested it into Splunk, and built custom dashboards and alerts to identify suspicious authentication behavior.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- 🖥️ **Splunk Free Tier (Local Instance)**
- 📂 **Synthetic Log File** (`synthetic_brute_force.log`)
- 🪟 **Windows Server 2022** (Simulated via VirtualBox)
- 📦 **Event IDs Used**: `4624` (Successful Logon), `4625` (Failed Logon)

---

## 🔧 Setup Overview

1. Created a synthetic `.log` file with 20 failed and 1 successful login attempt.
2. Uploaded the log into Splunk and assigned it to a custom index: `brute_force_lab`
3. Built a dashboard to visualize login patterns and possible brute force attacks.
4. Configured a simple alert for excessive failed login attempts.

## 🔍 Key SPL Queries Used

### 📈 Login Attempts Over Time
```spl
index=brute_force_lab (EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4625)
| eval EventType=if(EventCode==4625, "Failed Login", "Successful Login")
| timechart span=30s count by EventType
```

### 🌐 Top Attacking IPs
```spl
index=brute_force_lab EventCode=4625
| stats count by IpAddress
| sort -count
```

### 🎯 Brute Force Targets by Account
```spl
index=brute_force_lab EventCode=4625
| stats count by AccountName
| where count > 5
```

### 🧾 Successful Login Table
```spl
index=brute_force_lab EventCode=4624
| table _time AccountName IpAddress WorkstationName
```

## 📊 Dashboard Panels Built

| Panel Title              | Description                                        |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Login Attempts Over Time | Line chart of failed vs. successful logins         |
| Top Attacking IPs        | Bar chart of IPs with the most failed logins       |
| Brute Force Targets      | Accounts hit by repeated failures (>5)             |
| Successful Logins        | Table view of valid logins and origin details      |

---

## 🔔 Alert Logic (Optional)
```spl
index=brute_force_lab EventCode=4625
| stats count by IpAddress
| where count > 10
```
Triggers if any IP exceeds 10 failed logins within a short window.

## ✅ Takeaways
- Learned how to simulate and ingest event logs into Splunk
- Built SPL queries to detect login-based anomalies
- Gained hands-on experience with dashboards and alerting
- Practiced correlation of Event IDs 4624 and 4625 to spot brute force attacks
